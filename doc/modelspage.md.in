\page modelpage Model Format

The model format of @PROJECT_NAME@ encodes any series/ parallel combination of implemented impedances.

Currently @PROJECT_NAME@ supports the following elements which each have a number of parameters:
* c: cap
	* one parameter: capacitance {C}
* r: resistor
	* one parameter: resistance {R}
* l: inductor
	* one parameter: inductance {L}
* w: warburg element (infinite)
	* one parameter: Warburg coefficient {A}
* p: constant phase element
	* two parameters: {Q, alpha}
* t: finite approximation of a transition line
	* three parameters: capacitance, resistance, approximation order {C, R, n}

Element identifiers are case insensitive.

## Combinations

Combinations of these elements are achieved by writing them against each other for a parallel combination, or with a '-' in between for serial combinations:

"r-c" is thus a serial combination of a resistor and a capacitance:
| r-c |
| :---- |
| \image html r-c.svg width=300px; |
| \image latex r-c.pdf width=\textwidth/2 |

While "cr" is a parallel combination of a resistor and a capacitance:
| rc |
| :---- |
| \image html rc.svg width=300px  |
| \image latex rc.pdf width=\textwidth/2|

While "r-cr" is a parallel combination of a resistor and a capacitance in series with another resistance, not that the implicit parallel operator has operator precedence:
| r-cr |
| :---- |
| \image html r-rc.svg width=300px |
| \image latex r-rc.pdf width=\textwidth/2|

Brackets '(' and ')' are also supported and modify the order of operations as one would expect. Thus "(r-c)r" is a series combination of a resistor and a capacitance in parallel with another resistance:
| (r-c)r |
| :---- |
| \image html _r-c_r.svg width=300px |
| \image latex _r-c_r.pdf width=\textwidth/2|

## Parameters

To pass circuit element parameters to @PROJECT_NAME@ a format embedded into the strings is preferred. Parameters are passed by adding them in braces behind the element thus "r{100}-c{3e-6}r{1e4}" is a 100 Ohm resistor in series with a 3 microfarad capacitance that is in parallel with  a 3 kOhm resistance.

When an element takes multiple parameters, those are separated by a ',' like so: r{5e4}p{1e-5, 0.8}

Ranges are also supported, here ~ is used as a separator between the start and the end of a range, thus r{1~1e3} is a resistor with a value in a linear range between 1 and 1000 Ohms. By adding a trailing 'L' the range can be marked as distributed logarithmic in base 10, thus  r{1~1e3L} is such a logarithmic range.

Ranges are used to make @PROJECT_NAME@ generate spectra for all combinations of parameters in the range(s) of the circuit elements.
