\page modelpage Model Format

The model format of @PROJECT_NAME@ encodes any sieres/ parralell combination of implemented impedances

Curretly @PROJECT_NAME@ supports the following elements which eatch have a number of parameters:
* c: cap
	* one parameter: capacitance {C}
* r: resistor
	* one parameter: resistance {R}
* l: inductor
	* one parameter: inductance {L}
* w: warburg element (infinite), one parameters {A}
	* one parameter: Warburg coefficant {A}
* p: constant phase element
	* two parameters: {Q, alpha}
* t: finite approximation of a transmition line
	* three parameters: capacitance, resistance, approximation order {C, R, n}

## Combinations

Combinations of these elements are achived by writeing them against eatch other for a parralell combination, or with a '-' in between for serial combinatsions:

"r-c" is thus a serial combination of a resistor and a capacitance:
| r-c |
| :---- |

While "cr" is a parralell combination of a resistor and a capacitance:
| rc |
| :---- |
| \image html rc.svg width=300px |

While "r-cr" is a parralell combination of a resistor and a capacitance in series with another resistance, not that the implicit parralell operator has operator precedence:
| r-cr |
| :---- |

Brakets ( and ) are also support and modify the order of operations as one would expect "(r-c)r" is a series combination of a resistor and a capacitance in parralell with another resistance:
| (r-c)r |
| :---- |

## Parameters

To pass circut element parameters to @PROJECT_NAME@ a format embedded into the strings is perfered. Parameters are passed by adding them in braces behind the element thus "r{100}-c{3e-6}r{1e4}" is a 100 Ohm resistor in series with a 3 Microfarad capacitance that is in parralell with  a 3 kOhm resistance.

When a element takes multiple parameters, those are seperated by a ',' like so: r{5e4}-p{1e-5, 0.8}

Ranges are also supported, here ~ is used as a seperator between the start and the end of a range, thus r{1~1e3} is a resistor with a value in a linear range between 1 and 1000 Ohms. By adding a trailing 'L' the range can be marked as distrobuted logathithmicly in base 10, thus  r{1~1e3L} is sutch a logarithmic range.

Ranges are used to make @PROJECT_NAME@ generate spectra for all combinations of parameters in the range(s) of the circuit elements.

## Translators
